Cowsay is a configurable talking cow, written in Perl.  It operates
much as the figlet program does, and is written in the same spirit
of silliness.

To install cowsay, consult the INSTALL file in this directory.

See README.md for more details.

For the terms and conditions of use, consult the README.md and LICENSE.txt files
in this directory.
